# visual-fashion-recognition
Based on a photo of a clothing and your choices, the app provides you suggestions about your outfit.

## Process idea 
1. Analyse image (tell if recognizable or not)
2. Recognize the clothing (depending on the category of the dataset ie top, bottom, footwear and acc)
3. Propose a good "outfit" with some interactions with the user (in terms of color or textures)
